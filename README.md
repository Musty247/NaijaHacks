# NaijaHacks Byropoint

![Byropoint](img/logo.png)

Team Byropoint's hack for NaijaHacks 2018 is a simple educational app that provides daily tips on maintaining good personal hygiene and sustainable environmental sanity. The live version of the project can be viewed [here](https://github.com/davidconoh.github.io/naijahacks-byropoint)

This project aims to be very beginner friendly and advocate simplicity and clarity using the KISS model (Keep It Simple Stupid).

## Problem Statement

In a rapidly evolving world, it is quite unfortunate that the waste management systems in Nigeria and many other African countries still rely on age-old technologies and infrastructure when most developed nations are already investing heavily in crafting sustainable solutions for waste management using the 'Three R Model (Reduce, Recycle & Reuse)'.

Innovation is therefore required for developing our very own sustainable means of taking care of the environment and managing waste in the country. Although we still have a long way to go in establishing the right laws, policies and infrastructures that will improve our method of managing the environment, the proper senstization of the masses on personal hygiene principles and environmental sanitation best practices is a step in the right direction towards making our cities clean, safe and healthy for us to live.

By introducing byte-sized, understandable resources that educate the common man on how to maintain good hygiene and properly dispose waste materials, we can collectively craft solutions that are understood and accepted by locals while being sustainably run by the proper government agencies.
